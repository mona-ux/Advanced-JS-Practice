JavaScript String, Array, and Object Manipulation Tasks
This repository contains a series of tasks that demonstrate basic string, array, and object manipulation in JavaScript. The tasks cover common operations like converting text, counting characters, manipulating arrays, and working with objects.

String Methods
This section performs various operations on strings:

Uppercase and Lowercase Conversion - Converts the given sentence to uppercase and lowercase.
Character Count - Counts the total number of characters in a string, including spaces.
Character Frequency - Counts how many times a specific character (e.g., 'a') appears in the string.
Extract First and Last Word - Extracts and displays the first and last words of a sentence.
Remove Spaces - Removes all spaces from the sentence and displays the modified string.
Check String Start and End - Checks if the string starts or ends with a specific word (e.g., "Hello").
Split Sentence into Words - Splits the sentence into an array of words and displays it.
Replace Word in Sentence - Replaces all instances of a specific word (e.g., "good") with another word (e.g., "excellent").
Array Methods
This section demonstrates basic operations on arrays:

Add and Remove Array Elements - Adds a new number to the array and removes the first number.
Sort Array of Strings - Sorts an array of strings alphabetically.
Remove Duplicates from Array - Removes duplicate numbers from an array.
Find Largest and Smallest Numbers - Finds the largest and smallest numbers in an array manually.
Reverse Array - Reverses the order of elements in an array without using built-in functions.
Combine Two Arrays Alternately - Combines two arrays by alternately taking elements from each array.
Object Methods
This section demonstrates basic operations on objects:

Student Object - Creates a student object with properties like name, age, and class, and displays them.
Add New Property to Object - Adds a new property (e.g., grade) to the object and displays it.
Car Object - Creates an object representing a car, updates one of its properties, and displays the updated object.
Array of Objects - Creates multiple objects and stores them in an array, displaying each object's details.
Book Object - Creates an object for a book in a library, updates its availability, and displays the updated object.
Comprehensive Task
This task combines all the previous operations into a mini-database. It allows the following actions on an array of objects:

Add a new object to the array.
Update one of the object's properties.
Delete an object from the array.
Display all objects in the array with their properties.
