This script demonstrates fundamental JavaScript concepts including variable declarations, data types, string manipulation, arithmetic operations, and user interaction.

## Features

### 1. Variable Declaration and Reassignment
- **let**: Allows variables to be reassigned (e.g., `let age = 19`).
- **var**: Similar to `let`, but function-scoped (e.g., `var city = "Lahore"`).
- **const**: A constant value that cannot be reassigned (e.g., `const country = "Pakistan"`).

### 2. Data Types
- Demonstrates common data types in JavaScript:
  - **String** (`"Mona"`)
  - **Boolean** (`true`)
  - **Array** (`["Ali", "Sara", "Ahmed"]`)
  - **Object** (`{ firstName: "Mona", lastName: "Mobeen" }`)
  - **Number** (`95`)

### 3. String Manipulation
- Displays dynamic messages using template literals.
- Demonstrates calculating the length of a string.

### 4. Arithmetic Operations
- A series of arithmetic operations including:
  - **Summing** a list of numbers.
  - **Calculating the average** of those numbers.
  - **Multiplying** all numbers together.
  - Finding the **largest** and **smallest** numbers from a list.
  - Performing **complex arithmetic** operations using basic operators and built-in functions like `Math.pow()` and `Math.max()`.

### 5. User Interaction
- Asks the user for their name and displays a personalized greeting message.
- Implements a **simple calculator** where the user provides two numbers and receives the result of arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
