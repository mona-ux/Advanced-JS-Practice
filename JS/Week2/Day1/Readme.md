# JavaScript String, Array, and Object Manipulation Tasks

This repository contains a series of tasks that demonstrate basic string, array, and object manipulation in JavaScript. The tasks cover common operations like converting text, counting characters, manipulating arrays, and working with objects.

## String Methods

This section performs various operations on strings:

1. **Uppercase and Lowercase Conversion** - Converts the given sentence to uppercase and lowercase.
2. **Character Count** - Counts the total number of characters in a string, including spaces.
3. **Character Frequency** - Counts how many times a specific character (e.g., 'a') appears in the string.
4. **Extract First and Last Word** - Extracts and displays the first and last words of a sentence.
5. **Remove Spaces** - Removes all spaces from the sentence and displays the modified string.
6. **Check String Start and End** - Checks if the string starts or ends with a specific word (e.g., "Hello").
7. **Split Sentence into Words** - Splits the sentence into an array of words and displays it.
8. **Replace Word in Sentence** - Replaces all instances of a specific word (e.g., "good") with another word (e.g., "excellent").

## Array Methods

This section demonstrates basic operations on arrays:

1. **Add and Remove Array Elements** - Adds a new number to the array and removes the first number.
2. **Sort Array of Strings** - Sorts an array of strings alphabetically.
3. **Remove Duplicates from Array** - Removes duplicate numbers from an array.
4. **Find Largest and Smallest Numbers** - Finds the largest and smallest numbers in an array manually.
5. **Reverse Array** - Reverses the order of elements in an array without using built-in functions.
6. **Combine Two Arrays Alternately** - Combines two arrays by alternately taking elements from each array.

## Object Methods

This section demonstrates basic operations on objects:

1. **Student Object** - Creates a student object with properties like name, age, and class, and displays them.
2. **Add New Property to Object** - Adds a new property (e.g., grade) to the object and displays it.
3. **Car Object** - Creates an object representing a car, updates one of its properties, and displays the updated object.
4. **Array of Objects** - Creates multiple objects and stores them in an array, displaying each object's details.
5. **Book Object** - Creates an object for a book in a library, updates its availability, and displays the updated object.
